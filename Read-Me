a simple HTML page with embedded JavaScript code that calculates a person's age based on their national ID. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

HTML Structure:
The HTML structure defines a basic webpage with a title, a heading (<h1>), an input field for the national ID (<input>), a button (<button>), and a paragraph (<p>) to display the result.

JavaScript Function:
The returntext() function is invoked when the button is clicked. It retrieves the value entered in the national ID input field.
It then extracts the century and year of birth from the national ID.
It calculates the birth year based on the century and year obtained.
It gets the current year from the system date and calculates the person's age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.
Finally, it updates the paragraph with the ID "result" to display the calculated age.

Explanation of Calculations:
The script assumes that the first digit of the national ID represents the century (2 for 19th century, 3 for 20th century).
It extracts the second and third digits to determine the year of birth.
It calculates the birth year by adding the century to the extracted year.
Then, it subtracts the birth year from the current year to get the age.

Displaying the Result:
The calculated age is displayed in the paragraph with the ID "result" using document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = age;.

Execution:
When the user enters their national ID and clicks the "Get my age" button, the script calculates the age and displays it on the webpage.
Overall, this webpage provides a simple interface for users to input their national ID and obtain their age based on the extracted birth year and the current year.
